What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)
It's a portfolio of the assignment's we've completed this semester.

What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
I enjoyed Assignment 3 a lot. I already had a decent
sense of how the front end of a web app works, 
but I did not have as much knowledge about server-side. 
Seeing how the back end works by building our own API
of things works was very cool.

How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
While this course has not been the most intense programming class 
I have taken at Tufts, it has taught me skills I had no knowledge of 
from classes like COMP40 and COMP15. These skills include 
self teaching by reading stackoverflow and looking at github examples
and working in a team based enviornment. 

What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
How the internet actually works and fits together. Prior to this class, I had no idea how a website 
displayed information and took input from the user. Now when I go on sites like
reddit.com, I see how it's a combination of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and other web programming tools
rather than an indecipherable black box. I now understand how logging in to an account works. 
The username and password are put in to a database on the server side via a GET or POST request
and if there is a match that account's information is displayed. 

Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
I would like to understand how to incorporate relational databases like SQL
into web applications. It seems like a helpful skill
and hopefully would be a natural continuation from already learning 
about MongoDB, a non relational database.
