<h1>Assignment 4: Security</h1>
<h2>Patrick Wolfe</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The product is a geolocation based app that can 
take a user's location and return landmarks
nearby to that user as well as other users 
that have logged into the app and their locations. 
I have been hired to examine the app for any 
potential security vulnerabilities. 	
</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>
First I attempted to look for any vulnerabilites 
using black box testing. This meant accessing 
the app without looking at the actual source code. 
I used the Postman application to send POST requests
and for GET requests simply used the address
bar in my browser. After that I looked at the source
code for the application by cloning the 
heroku app using git which allowed me to take 
a closer look at how the app works in order 
to pinpoint possible sources of vulnerabilities. 
</p>

<h3>Abstract of Findings</h3>
<p>
	
</p>

<h3>Issues Found</h3>
<p>
<li>Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in '/sendLocation POST' request</li>
<p>Severity: high - can completely destroy functionality for '/' GET request that displays checkins.</p>
<p></p>

<br />
<li>Mongo Injection vulnerability in '/checkins.json' GET request/</li>
<p>Severity: medium - this will not destroy functionality for any aspect of the app but it is a serious privacy concern as a user can view all the information for users in the database without knowning their logins.</p>


<li></li>
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
These vulnerabilities can be removed using good security practices. HTML encoding the login string will prevent the user from inserting
JavaScript into the database, which will then cause issues when the logins are displayed in HTML. This can be done by writing a 
basic JavaScript function that takes a string as a parameter and returns the same string except with '<' and '>' encoded 
to '& lt;' and '& gt;' respectively (with no space following the &). This will cause logins with those characters to appear the 
same to the user, but HTML will not look at them as tags so &lt;script&gt; cannot be inserted into the page.
