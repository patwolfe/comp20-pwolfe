1. I believe all the requirements have been successfully implemented.
I realized after pushing that the commit message about citations 
in the readme and adding addListener functions was probably too 
long, so in the future I will try to avoid that. I tried 
to commit every time I added a feature or fixed a bug,
I apologize if more commits were expected.  

2. I recieved TA help when I encountered an issue where the map 
was not being displayed after initialization and learned it
was because the css file was not set up properly. I also
used the internet to learn about using the keyword
"this" within for loops (seen when iterating through
landmarks and people arrays).
Additionally, I used the geolocation_map.html and create_map.js
files on Ming's github to get an idea 
of how to render a map on an HTML page for the javascript on the page. 
I also used the whereintheworld.html file to review the syntax
for ajax before implementing Xml HTTP requests into 
the javascript. 

3. I spent about 14 hours on this assignment
